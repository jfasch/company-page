Over the years, being an engineer at heart, I had to do fun projects
in my spare time. Most of these revolve around my obsession --- err
profession --- of build management and software development in
general.

* <%= link_to_name('Confix', 'confix') %> is a build tool written in
  Python. With a very simple build definition it generates build
  definitions for the lower-level tools
  [Automake](http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/) and
  [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/).
* <%= link_to_name('jf-unittest', 'jf-unittest') %> is a simple yet
  complete unit test framework written in C++. I hear you: "Why would
  the world need yet another unit test framework?". Answer: for C++
  there is nothing out there that satisfies me. Your mileage may vary
  --- perhaps your project depends on so many things already that a
  unit test framework *and its own dependencies* don't matter. I don't
  like dependencies, and <%= link_to_name('jf-unittest',
  'jf-unittest') %> has none.
* <%= link_to_name('jf-linuxtools', 'jf-linuxtools') %> is a package
  that contains small utilities (and their unit tests) to accompany
  <%= link_to_name('the course in systems programming',
  'courses-sysprog') %>.
