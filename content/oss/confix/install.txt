You can download releases [on the Sourceforge project
site](https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=68975). If
no release is recent enough, you may always checkout a [development
version from
Subversion](http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=68975). You can also
[browse the Subversion repository without having a Subversion client
installed](http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/confix/).

Follow the instructions in the [INSTALL
file](http://confix.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/confix/confix/trunk/INSTALL?view=markup),
or read on.

    $ pwd
    /home/jfasch/download
    $ tar jxf Confix-2.2.0.tar.bz2
    $ cd Confix-2.2.0
    $ python setup.py install --prefix=${HOME}/sandbox

Then, provided you gave a non-default prefix (when you omit
`--prefix`, the package goes to `/usr/local`), you should update your
environment accordingly. For example, you could add the following
lines to your `~/.bashrc`:

    PREFIX=${HOME}/sandbox
    export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:${PREFIX}/lib/pythonA.B/site-packages
    export PATH=${PATH}:${PREFIX}/bin

Make sure A.B corresponds to the version of Python that you use, such as 2.4.

That's it, you're ready to use Confix. Try out the installation by
calling up the command line help:

    $ confix2.py --help
