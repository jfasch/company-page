Open Source Training Material
-----------------------------

**Why?**

* Nobody does it
* Trainers (even those in Open Source tech) *don't work together*
* ... although, historically, OSS has gained incredible momentum
* Expecting the same in training context

**How?** (This project)

* Define and implement common basis
* Provide in-depth documentation
* Provide representative examples

Walk-Through
------------

* Python training (:download:`PDF
  </trainings/material/pdf/300-python.pdf>`)
* Show :doc:`graph: Python training <demo/python>`

  * Pinpoint: "Iteration and Generators" *depends on* "Functions"

* Show :doc:`"Iteration and Generators"
  </trainings/material/soup/python/python_1010_generators_yield/topic>`
* Show :doc:`agenda <demo/agenda>`, and *how easy it is*
* Note that use not restricted to technical training

  * Even can do :doc:`project management <plan/plan>`

Requirements
------------

* Web-native
* Easy markup
* No binary format |Longrightarrow| no Libreoffice, no PowerPoint, no Keynote
* No proprietary format |Longrightarrow| no PowerPoint, no Keynote
* No closed source |Longrightarrow| no nothing
* Small topics of manageable size (ideally 15-30min, the average size
  of a screencast/tutorial)
* Dependencies: :doc:`"Iteration and Generators"
  </trainings/material/soup/python/python_1010_generators_yield/topic>`
  *depends on* :doc:`"Functions"
  </trainings/material/soup/python/python_0270_functions/topic>`
* Various other metadata easily introduced

Open Ends
---------

* Slide/Presentation

  * `S5
    <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/user/slide-shows.html>`__
  * `reveal.js <https://revealjs.com/>`__
  * `Webslides <https://webslides.tv/>`__

* Use dependency metadata more

  * Compute textual agenda
  * Fisheye view on one topic
  * ...

* Structure

  * Relations between multiple training material websites

* Visual enhancements (many)

Communication
-------------

* Github Repositories
* Announce and promote (Facebook/LinkedIn)
